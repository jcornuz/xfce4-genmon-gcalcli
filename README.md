# xfce4-genmon-gcalcli

An Xfce4 Genmon script which uses gcalcli and cal to display current month(s) and agenda.

Uses Xfce4 Genmon: https://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-genmon-plugin

And gcalcli: https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli

to give you a clock in your Xfce4 panel which loads your calendar program on click. It also shows a tooltip with the current month(s) as weel as your next appointment(s) in your gmail calendars.

It is minimally configurable: how many months do you want to show, how many days of appointments and the color of the current date \o/
